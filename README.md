# Digital Forest: A December FPGA Challenge üå≤‚ú®

**Welcome to the Digital Forest!**  
Embark on a December-long FPGA adventure inspired by **Advent of Code**, where you‚Äôll tackle five hardware design challenges that progressively grow in complexity. This project blends storytelling with technical exploration, teaching key FPGA concepts through engaging and practical tasks.

## üåü Project Overview

The **Digital Forest** challenge series consists of five tasks. These tasks are designed for FPGA boards and focus on using Hardware Description Laanguages (HDLs). While this project is developed on the **RealDigital Urbana Board**, you are welcome to use any FPGA board you prefer.

## üìÖ Release Schedule

The challenges are time-released throughout December.

- **Challenge 1**: December 1, 2024
- **Challenge 2**: December 5, 2024
- **Challenge 3**: December 11, 2024
- **Challenge 4**: December 18, 2024
- **Challenge 5**: December 25, 2024

Each challenge will be unlocked in this repository on the specified date. Stay tuned!

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To participate, you‚Äôll need:
- An FPGA development board.
- A hardware description language (HDL) toolchain installed:
  - **AMD Vivado** for Xilinx boards.
  - **Intel Quartus Prime** for Intel boards.
- Basic familiarity with Verilog or VHDL.

While some prior knowledge of HDLs is recommended, the challenges include hints to guide you through.
